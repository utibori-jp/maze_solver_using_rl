## What's difference from [deep learining from scratch 4](https://github.com/oreilly-japan/deep-learning-from-scratch-4)?
* Maze shape
I expanded the shape of maze from 3*4 to 4*5 and added to 2 blocks and 1 penalty area.
* Framework for deep learning.
I used PyTorch for solve maze instead of the original framework DeZero made in [deep learining from scratch 3](https://github.com/oreilly-japan/deep-learning-from-scratch-3), which is used in [deep learning from scratch 4](https://github.com/oreilly-japan/deep-learning-from-scratch-4).
